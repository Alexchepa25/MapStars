            <h3>The technology of Motivation and Social <br>Recommendations</h3>
            <p>  Motivation technology is a proprietary development of our company. It is designed to increase the number of reviews and recommendations about your business at the expense of old customers, which directly affects the number of new customers.</p><br>
            <p>To implement the technology, we use carriers - motivators. They come in various formats: a tabletop, a signboard, a banner, a business card, a sticker, a product packaging element, a leaflet, and so on. Our task is to integrate the use of the motivator into your business process.</p><br>
            <p>With your help or on your own, the client, using a mobile device, read the QR code from the motivator and goes to a special website of the institution's complaint. On this page, he will be able to share social recommendations and leave feedback about visiting your establishment, thus promoting you on the network. Advertising messages about your establishment will be distributed on social networks (Facebook, Instagram) or in the form of messages via instant messengers (Viber, WhatsApp, Telegram).</p><br>
            <p> The introduction of technology significantly increases the number of reviews left on Google Maps, which subsequently increases the popularity and frequency of issuance in Google services. Each client turns into a tool to attract new visitors, our technology is a modern version of word of mouth for your business.</p>

          <p class="text">Today, the largest search resource on the planet is Google Search. It is practically a monopoly in the field of information search. That is why our company, when creating its GEO advertising technology, used this system as a basis.</p><br>
          <p>Let's figure out together how exactly Google Search works.</p><br>
          <p>When a user enters a search query, Google Search processes it in less than one second and returns the search results in a specific sequence.</p><br>
          <p>Android phones, 75% of phones based on other systems, as well as laptops and home computers use Google in one or another way.</p>

            <span class="tit-ad">First block:</span><br>
            <span class="tit-ad">Advertisements</span>
            <p class="text-ad">Search results tagged "advertising". Such ads are always displayed at the top of the list (from 1 to 4 ads) and at the bottom of the list (from 1 to 5 ads). The place in the list is determined by the Google Adwords auction.
            Google Adwords guarantees your ad or website visits but requires constant financial investment. For example, the cost of such advertising per month for clothing stores in Lisbon will be about 5000 €. and more. Agree, not every small or medium business can afford such an advertising budget. However, our clients often use Adwords in tandem with GEO advertising.</p>

            <p>Any business seeks to make a profit through customer satisfaction. But satisfying such needs, no business seeks to use the client to promote their product or service. This happens on its own, in the form of "word of mouth", as it is popularly called. Modern business keeps in touch with the client using mobile applications such as Instagram, Telegram or Twitter, instant messengers (Viber, Skype, WhatsApp), or social networks (Facebook, etc.).</p><br>
            <p>What if we offer you a simple technique that will allow you to bring more new customers at the expense of old ones, using social networks and mobile applications? Moreover, not on the scale of a simple word of mouth, but a modern one, using the above social networks and mobile applications?</p><br>

            <p>Ceramic Pro is the first client of the company in Latvia, as well as the first client abroad.</p><br>
            <p>After changing the car wash system and approach to working with the client, under the new Ceramic Pro brand, the task was to bring more customers in the 16/17 tourist season than in the 15/16 season.</p><br>
            <p>The main focus of the photo session/photo presentation was to be the Ceramic Pro logo and new corporate identity, as well as the workflow and higher level of the average customer. This project has become a pilot project for our company in terms of introducing a unique Motivator design with the logo of the client's company. The task was also to orient the issue in Google search for a Russian-speaking tourist/client.</p><br>
            <p>The result was not long in coming, already in the next 16/17 season in Jurmala, 17% more customers turned to the car wash than in the 15/16 season. According to our forecasts, they should grow up to 25% over the next.</p>

          <p>Any business seeks to make a profit through customer satisfaction. But satisfying such needs, no business seeks to use the client to promote their product or service. This happens on its own, in the form of "word of mouth", as it is popularly called. Modern business keeps in touch with the client using mobile applications such as Instagram, Telegram or Twitter, instant messengers (Viber, Skype, WhatsApp), or social networks (Facebook, etc.).</p><br>
          <p>What if we offer you a simple technique that will allow you to bring more new customers at the expense of old ones, using social networks and mobile applications? Moreover, not on the scale of a simple word of mouth, but a modern one, using the above social networks and mobile applications?</p><br>    
          <p>With a few simple implementation steps, and simple instructions for use and your clients will work for you.</p>
